    <h1>Privacy Policy for Routina (Easy Habit Tracker)</h1>
    
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: August 24, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how Routina (Easy Habit Tracker) ("we," "our," or "us") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Routina is designed with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information or habit data to our servers or any third-party services. Your privacy is fully protected because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All habit tracking data is stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li>We do not require user accounts or registration</li>
        <li>We do not collect analytics, usage statistics, or crash reports</li>
        <li>We do not access your device's camera, location, contacts, or other sensitive features</li>
        <li>We do not use advertising networks or tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Export</h2>
    <p>Your habit tracking data (such as habit names, completion status, and any notes you add) is stored entirely on your device. The app includes functionality to export your data as a JSON file, which you can save, share, or import as you choose. This export feature is under your complete control.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Currently, Routina does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs. All app functionality operates locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Future Updates</h2>
    <p>If we add features in future updates that involve data collection (such as push notifications or cloud syncing), we will update this privacy policy and notify users through the app store update description. Any such features will be clearly explained and, where applicable, optional.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected or transmitted, our app is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store your personal data on our servers, there is no personal data for us to delete, modify, or transfer. You have complete control over your data through the app's local storage and export functionality.</p>
